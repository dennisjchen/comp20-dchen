FroggerAssignment part 2

1. All basic things have been correctly implemented including:
-Game loads immediately
-Frogger moves on campus using up,down,left,right
-Animate vehicles and logs
-Collision detection
-Basic game scoring

For additional implementations, there are
-Score that also takes into account time (they have 60 seconds to get to a lilypad)
-Game levels (things move faster with each level)
-Sounds play when frogger moves or dies or levels up.
