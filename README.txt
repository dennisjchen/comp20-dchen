Dennis Chen
Class: Comp20

Favorite project was scorecenter because it taught me about database and storage and interacting with it.

The favorite lab was the running status updates because it taught me about persistent data and the like.

I definitely think I've grown in taking this class, I've learned a lot of practical things that I will
definitely use later. I learned lots about GIT, Javascript and it's cool to see things be so useful.
I also definitely have to learn to read better because I always get caught up on mistakes on quizzes.
