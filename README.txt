Class: Comp20

Favorite project was frogger because I have always dreamed of making a simple game and this class
let me do it! It was one of those times where I just could not stop coding even if I wanted to.
I wanted to get it done, push through it and get it to work perfectly. It was super fun.

The project that I was most proud of was scorecenter because it taught me about database and storage
and interacting with it. It really pushed my limits since I have never dealt with anything like this
before and it was fun! I will definitely be able to use this experience in the future and even though
the project was time consuming, it was worth it.

I definitely think I've grown in taking this class, I've learned a lot of practical things that I will
definitely use later. I learned lots about GIT, Javascript and it's cool to see things be so useful.
I also definitely have to learn to read better because I always get caught up on mistakes on quizzes.
All of the labs, quizzes and projects made the class interesting and super fun. Being able to learn new
languages as well as increase my knowledge in areas made this class a great addition to everything else
that I learned.
